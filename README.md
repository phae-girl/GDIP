=================

This is the first push of the stable and working project GDIP. GDIP is a status bar app for OS X Mountain Lion built and tested on version 10.8.2. The purpose of the app is to answer the question "What's my GD IP?" without popping open a browser window. This version borrows heavily from the article *[A Cocoa application driven by HTTP data][1]* by Matt Gallagher at Cocoa with Love. 

Please note that there is no pre-built binary. If you want to use this app, you'll need to build it yourself. I'm sure if you're reading this, you have the ability to do that. 

If you have any questions or comments you can find me here on GitHub or at [www.veganswithtypewriters.com][2].

=========

Really, this is such a trivial app that anyone could have thought it up, and I'm surprised that nobody hasn't. Do what you want with it. It would be nice if you threw me a mention, but whatever, it's your electrons.
